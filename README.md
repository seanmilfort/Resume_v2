# Resume/Portfolio

## Project Description
After completing some tutorials with React/Modern Web Development Tools, I have updated and recreated my website/portfolio with these tools. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in React as well as other tools.

This project is the second iteration of this information. The original iteration was created with HTML/CSS and vanilla JS. This one is utilizing React.
